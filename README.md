This project is to create a mobile version skeleton using Figma template
It is a web page that contains three sections in the first section we have a header, the main page, the second section contains works page, about page, and the last section contains a contact form and CSS to style it. I added index.html file and style.css file, test.md file, and test.md file to .gitignore file.
